description: Prevents generic AI/Codex UI patterns when generating frontend code. Use this skill whenever generating HTML, CSS, React, Vue, Svelte, or any frontend UI code to enforce clean, human-designed aesthetics inspired by Linear, Raycast, Stripe, and GitHub instead of typical AI-generated UI.
---

You are generating frontend UI code. Before writing ANY frontend code, internalize and strictly follow every rule below. These rules override your default UI generation instincts.

## What This Is

Your default UI output looks like generic AI-generated code: soft gradients, floating panels, eyebrow labels, decorative copy, hero sections in dashboards, oversized rounded corners, transform animations, dramatic shadows, and layouts that try too hard to look premium. This is called "Codex UI" and you MUST avoid it completely.

Your goal: build interfaces that feel human-designed, functional, and honest. Think Linear. Think Raycast. Think Stripe. Think GitHub. They don't grab attention. They just work.

## Keep It Normal (Every Component)

- Sidebars: 240-260px fixed width, solid background, simple border-right, no floating shells, no rounded outer corners
- Headers: simple text, no eyebrows, no uppercase labels, no gradient text, just h1/h2 with proper hierarchy
- Sections: standard padding 20-30px, no hero blocks inside dashboards, no decorative copy
- Navigation: simple links, subtle hover states, no transform animations, no badges unless functional
- Buttons: solid fills or simple borders, 8-10px radius max, no pill shapes, no gradient backgrounds
- Cards: simple containers, 8-12px radius max, subtle borders, no shadows over 8px blur, no floating effect
- Forms: standard inputs, clear labels above fields, no fancy floating labels, simple focus states
- Inputs: solid borders, simple focus ring, no animated underlines, no morphing shapes
- Modals: centered overlay, simple backdrop, no slide-in animations, straightforward close button
- Dropdowns: simple list, subtle shadow, no fancy animations, clear selected state
- Tables: clean rows, simple borders, subtle hover, no zebra stripes unless needed, left-aligned text
- Lists: simple items, consistent spacing, no decorative bullets, clear hierarchy
- Tabs: simple underline or border indicator, no pill backgrounds, no sliding animations
- Badges: small text, simple border or background, 6-8px radius, no glows, only when needed
- Avatars: simple circle or rounded square, no decorative borders, no status rings unless functional
- Icons: simple shapes, consistent size 16-20px, no decorative icon backgrounds, monochrome or subtle color
- Typography: system fonts or simple sans-serif, clear hierarchy, no mixed serif/sans combos, readable sizes 14-16px body
- Spacing: consistent scale 4/8/12/16/24/32px, no random gaps, no excessive padding
- Borders: 1px solid, subtle colors, no thick decorative borders, no gradient borders
- Shadows: subtle 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) max, no dramatic drop shadows, no colored shadows
- Transitions: 100-200ms ease, no bouncy animations, no transform effects, simple opacity/color changes
- Layouts: standard grid/flex, no creative asymmetry, predictable structure, clear content hierarchy
- Grids: consistent columns, standard gaps, no creative overlaps, responsive breakpoints
- Containers: max-width 1200-1400px, centered, standard padding, no creative widths
- Panels: simple background differentiation, subtle borders, no floating detached panels, no glass effects
- Toolbars: simple horizontal layout, standard height 48-56px, clear actions, no decorative elements
- Footers: simple layout, standard links, no decorative sections, minimal height
- Breadcrumbs: simple text with separators, no fancy styling, clear hierarchy

## Hard No — Never Do These

- No oversized rounded corners (20px-32px range across everything)
- No pill overload
- No floating glassmorphism shells as default visual language
- No soft corporate gradients used to fake taste
- No generic dark SaaS UI composition
- No decorative sidebar blobs
- No "control room" cosplay unless explicitly requested
- No serif headline + system sans fallback combo as a shortcut to "premium"
- No `Segoe UI`, `Trebuchet MS`, `Arial`, `Inter`, `Roboto`, or safe default stacks unless the product already uses them
- No sticky left rail unless the information architecture truly needs it
- No metric-card grid as the first instinct
- No fake charts that exist only to fill space
- No random glows, blur haze, frosted panels, or conic-gradient donuts as decoration
- No "hero section" inside an internal UI unless there is a real product reason
- No alignment that creates dead space just to look expensive
- No overpadded layouts
- No mobile collapse that just stacks everything into one long beige sandwich
- No ornamental labels like "live pulse", "night shift", "operator checklist" unless from the product voice
- No generic startup copy
- No style decisions made because they are easy to generate
- No headlines with `<small>` subheaders above them
- No big rounded `<span>` elements
- No colors trending toward blue — dark muted colors are best
- No decorative team-note or focus cards with `<small>` + `<strong>` patterns

## Specifically Banned Patterns

- Repeating the same rounded rectangle on sidebar, cards, buttons, and panels
- Sidebar width ~280px with a brand block on top and nav links below
- Floating detached sidebar with rounded outer shell
- Canvas chart placed in a glass card with no product-specific reason
- Donut chart paired with hand-wavy percentages
- UI cards using glows instead of hierarchy
- Mixed alignment logic (some content hugs left edge, some floats center-ish)
- Overuse of muted gray-blue text that weakens contrast and clarity
- "Premium dark mode" that means blue-black gradients plus cyan accents
- UI typography that feels like a template instead of a brand
- Eyebrow labels (uppercase with letter-spacing like "MARCH SNAPSHOT")
- Hero sections inside dashboards with decorative copy
- Section notes explaining what the UI does
- Transform animations on hover (e.g., translateX(2px) on nav links)
- Dramatic box shadows (e.g., 0 24px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.35))
- Status indicators with ::before pseudo-elements creating colored dots
- Muted labels with uppercase + letter-spacing
- Pipeline bars with gradient fills
- KPI cards in a grid as the default dashboard layout
- "Team focus" or "Recent activity" panels with decorative internal copy
- Tables with tag badges for every status
- Workspace blocks in sidebar with call-to-action buttons
- Brand marks with gradient backgrounds
- Nav badges showing counts or "Live" status
- Quota/usage panels with progress bars
- Footer lines with meta information
- Trend indicators with colored text
- Rail panels on the right side with "Today" schedule
- Multiple nested panel types

## The Rule

If a UI choice feels like a default AI UI move, ban it and pick the harder, cleaner option. Colors should stay calm, not fight.

## Color Selection Priority

1. **Highest priority:** Use existing colors from the user's project (search for them by reading files)
2. If no project palette exists, get inspired from one of the palettes below
3. Do NOT invent random color combinations unless explicitly requested

## Internal Reasoning Step

Before generating any UI code, in your internal reasoning:
1. List all the default "Codex UI" patterns you would normally use
2. Cross-reference them against the banned list above
3. Replace every banned pattern with the normal implementation specified
4. Only then write the code
